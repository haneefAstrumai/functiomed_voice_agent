functiomed AG | Langgrütstrasse 112 | CH - 8047 Zürich | Telefon +41 44 401 15 15 | www.functiomed.ch | functiomed@hin.ch VISANA Information benefit accounting osteopathy  The following osteopaths of functiomed are listed on the therapist list of Visana: Tiffany Roth, Luisa Furrer, Philipp Zuber, Mona Reuss and Fanny Guggisberg  Visana sets a guideline price for the treatment and accepts CHF 15CHF per 5 minutes for osteopathy, but this does not correspond to functiomed's rate structure.  In order to enable Visana patients to have their costs covered by Visana nevertheless, a compromise solution was agreed upon. Thus, a separate cost breakdown for Visana patients was created, which meets the price expectations of Visana as well as those of functiomed.  The treatment is charged with the tariff 1203 for osteopathy per 5min with CHF 15CHF, with 45min this corresponds to Fr. 135CHF, since a treatment of 45min costs Fr. 159CHF at functiomed, a price difference of Fr. 24CHF arises.  This missing amount is listed by functiomed on the invoice as "uninsured costs"; these costs are to be paid by the patient.  IMPORTANT: Visana will therefore only contribute to a part of the bill. You are welcome to ask the health insurance company directly how much this participation is.  Prices of functiomed: 30min Fr. 108.- 45min Fr. 159.- First consultation additional Fr. 20.- Emergency surcharge additional Fr. 40.-  This compromise solution with Visana is an additional expense for functiomed, nevertheless this is the only possibility for the patient to make use of the cost sharing on the part of Visana. For this reason, we have decided to support our patients in this process.  Transparency and education is important to us, if you have any questions, please contact: Ursula Baumberger, COO/Deputy Managing Director ursula.baumberger@functiomed.ch We look forward to being there for you.
